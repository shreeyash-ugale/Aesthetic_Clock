<h2>Here is the Aesthetic Clock with ligth and dark mode</h2>
<p>An analog clock project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a web-based clock that displays the current time in a traditional analog clock format. It uses HTML to create the clock structure, CSS to style it and JavaScript to provide dynamic updates to the clock display based on real-time changes in the system time. This project is a great way to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build a functional and visually appealing clock application.</p>
